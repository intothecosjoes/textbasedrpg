The name of this tavern is 'The Blood and Vine Tavern' in the small town of Belron. Your sharp senses are semi-diluted by the loud music and the dust cloud forming from towns people dancing on the dirt floor. However, in the middle of poor rendition of 'The Ballad of Agi the Proud' the weathered doors of the tavern burst open showing a battered middle-age human man. He takes a moment to catch his breath before loudly pleading 'Please, they have taken my boy! Someone please help me! My boy is gone!'";
